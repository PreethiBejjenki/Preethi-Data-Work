SELECT PropertyAddress,
    SUBSTRING(PropertyAddress, 1, CHARINDEX(',',PropertyAddress)-1) AS Address,
	 SUBSTRING(PropertyAddress, CHARINDEX(',',PropertyAddress)+1, LEN(PropertyAddress)) AS City
FROM housing;


SELECT PropertyAddress: This part of the query selects the PropertyAddress column from the housing table. It's the starting point for extracting the address and city components.

SUBSTRING(PropertyAddress, 1, CHARINDEX(',', PropertyAddress) - 1) AS Address: This part of the query uses the SUBSTRING function to extract the address part from the PropertyAddress column. Here's the breakdown:

SUBSTRING(PropertyAddress, 1, CHARINDEX(',', PropertyAddress) - 1): This function call takes three arguments:
PropertyAddress: The source string from which to extract.
1: The starting position of the substring extraction (in this case, from the beginning of the string).
CHARINDEX(',', PropertyAddress) - 1: The length of the substring to extract. It's determined by finding the position of the comma in the PropertyAddress and subtracting 1 to exclude the comma. This extracts the street address part of the address.
SUBSTRING(PropertyAddress, CHARINDEX(',', PropertyAddress) + 1, LEN(PropertyAddress)) AS City: This part of the query uses the SUBSTRING function to extract the city part from the PropertyAddress column. Here's the breakdown:

SUBSTRING(PropertyAddress, CHARINDEX(',', PropertyAddress) + 1, LEN(PropertyAddress)): This function call takes three arguments:
PropertyAddress: The source string from which to extract.
CHARINDEX(',', PropertyAddress) + 1: The starting position of the substring extraction, which is just after the comma.
LEN(PropertyAddress): The length of the substring to extract. This extracts the entire remaining portion of the address after the comma, including the city and state parts.
